My emacs related files 'n setting etc....

I'm an emacs noob, and the first thing I wanted to do, was to keep my emacs settings consistant across systems... You're welcome to copy these as much as you'd like.. I make no claim to the originality of any of this, nor do I claim this to be logically sound, or even functional... Basically.... Use at your own risk.
